YOLOv5 is an efficient real-time object detection algorithm widely used in various computer vision tasks. To achieve a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), we adopted the PyQt framework. PyQt is a set of Python bindings for the Qt library, used for creating cross-platform applications.

In this study, we first trained and optimized the YOLOv5 model to meet specific object detection requirements. Then, we designed and implemented a PyQt-based GUI, allowing users to load images or videos and view detection results in real time. We detailed the steps of integrating the YOLOv5 model into a PyQt application, including model loading, image preprocessing, object detection, and result display.
